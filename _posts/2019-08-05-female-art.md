I came across this great article in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/16/why-womens-art-sells-at-a-discount) a while ago that highlighted a [new study](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/182452/1/1031264264.pdf)
by four social scientists from . Their paper investigates the impact an artists's gender might have on the auction prices that could be achieved for his or her art.

I very much enjoyed reading the article and the original study because their methodology seemed sound to me and the effect sizes that they report are quite significant even after accounting for potential skew in the data.

What I've taken away from reading the article is that how much we value the work of others might be influenced by the person who produced an artwork, a novel, or some software by more than we think.
It prompted me to make a conscious effort to judge any piece of writing or code that I get to review in my day-to-day first and foremost based on the work itself and to put aside my own impression of the person behind it.

Enjoy reading!
