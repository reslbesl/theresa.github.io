15th August will mark my 1000th day at Privitar, and sadly also my last day as an employee there.
I took this occasion as an opportunity to write down everything that I have learned about privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies and present it to my colleagues.
Here's a summary of this talk.

Privacy is contextual
---
The first thing I got to learn after I started working for a software start-up focused on data privacy is all the ways in which privacy is different from security.
The complexity in building privacy-preserving data procesing systems often lies in defining what is the information we want to hide and what is the information we want to extract.
This line, the line that defines what are valid inferences and what is going to be considered a privacy breach, is blurry and often hard to define up-front.
It further depends on a whole host of contextual factors, such as the type of information shared, the context, the data environment, the person accessing the data, and the analytical goal for which the data is accessed.

It is hard, however, to design technologies that aim to protect what can't be expressed in a formal framework and is so highly contextual.

Privacy-enhancing technologies are very problem-specific
