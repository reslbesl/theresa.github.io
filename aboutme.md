I am a PhD Research Assistant at the [SPRING Lab at EPFL](https://spring.epfl.ch/) (Switzerland) led by Carmela Troncoso.

My research focuses on the potentially harmful aspects of data processing systems centred around questions such as: How to evaluate the privacy properties of opaque data processing systems?
What are the privacy limits of machine learning-based applications? What learning tasks are solvable under good privacy and good utility simultaneously?
My work has been featured on multiple [national media outlets](https://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2021-03/corona-app-luca-kontaktverfolgung-einsatz-umstritten-kontakte-politik-lobbyismus) and continues to [inform policy makers](https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2021-12/techsonar_2021-2022_report_en.pdf) on a national and European level.

Before joining EPFL, I previously worked as a privacy researcher for Privitar, a London-based scale-up, where I developed enterprise software that implements privacy-enhancing technologies and aims to makes these technologies available to organisations at scale.
I hold a Master's degree in Neural Information Processing (Biomathematics) from the University of Tübingen (Germany).
