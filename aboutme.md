I am a Privacy Researcher at Privitar, a London-based startup using cryptographic and statistical techniques to open up data for safe secondary use, without violating individual privacy.

My research focuses on improving existing privacy-enhancing technologies such as Differential Privacy and developing new algorithms for applications such as disclosure risk assessment, secure data aggregation or safe data linkage.

As part of my role, I conducted consulting work for a large telecommunications company and a major bank.

Before joining Privitar and focusing on the privacy aspects of data science, I was a computational neuroscientist, developing statistical models to understand visual information processing in the mammalian visual system.

I graduated with an MSc in Neural Information Processing from the International Graduate Centre for Neuroscience at the University of TÃ¼bingen and have a background in biomathematics and applied statistics.
