I am a PhD Research Assistant at the [SPRING](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/spring/) Lab at EPFL (Switzerland) led by [Carmela Troncoso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sMkt3SgAAAAJ).

My research focuses primarily on the privacy aspects of large-scale data processing systems centred around questions such as:
How to evaluate the privacy properties of opaque data processing systems? What are the privacy limits of machine learning-based applications? What learning tasks are solvable under good privacy and good utility simultaneously?

Before joining the SPRING Lab, I previously worked as a privacy researcher for [Privitar](https://www.privitar.com) a London-based scale-up. Privitar develops enterprise software that implements privacy-enhancing technologies and aims to makes these technologies available to organisations at scale.

I hold a Master's degree in Neural Information Processing (Biomathematics) from the University of Tübingen (Germany).
During my undergraduate and graduate studies I conducted research in Applied Machine Learning under, amongst others, [Philipp Berens](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lPQLk3QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mathias Bethge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0z0fNxUAAAAJ).
