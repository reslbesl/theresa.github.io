I am currently a PhD student at the [SPRING](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/spring/) Lab at EPFL supervised by Carmela Troncoso.

My research centers  around questions like: What are the right techniques to assess *privacy risks* in different data sharing scenarios?
How can we measure private information leakage from generative and predictive machine learning models? 

Before I joined the amazing SPRING Lab, I worked as a Privacy Researcher for Privitar, a London-based startup using cryptographic and statistical techniques to open up data for safe secondary use, without violating individual privacy.

My research there focused on improving existing privacy-enhancing technologies such as Differential Privacy and developing new algorithms for applications such as disclosure risk assessment, secure data aggregation or safe data linkage.

As part of my role, I conducted consulting work for a large telecommunications company and a major bank.

Before that I was a computational neuroscientist, developing statistical models to understand visual information processing in the mammalian visual system.

I graduated with an MSc in Neural Information Processing from the International Graduate Centre for Neuroscience at the University of TÃ¼bingen and have a background in biomathematics and applied statistics.
