Over time I assembled a collection of recyclable Python code chunks that I re-use quite a lot.
I hope that making them available spares you some time wasted searching for the answer to "How do I format my plot legend in exactly the way I want to?" on five different StackOverflow posts.

It is an attempt to reverse the paradigm of Q&A from "I have an issue and I don't know how to solve it" to "I figured out how to do this and I will share it just in case somebody else finds it useful".

(They are mostly about creating beautiful data visualisations so a secondary goal of this collection is certainly also to increase the standards for plotting in Python.)
