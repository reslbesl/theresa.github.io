What does it mean to protect privacy in large-scale data processing systems?

This is the most basic question we need to answer when designing systems that, we claim, are mindful of individuals’ privacy.
A good privacy definition ideally should capture what privacy means to us but at the same time be precise enough so that it can be implemented and validated against.

On a very high level, the goal of my research is to find such a criterion, that strikes the right balance between interpretability and technical precision, is generalisable across data-processing systems but simultaneously adaptable to context-specific privacy concerns.

Design of Privacy Evaluation Frameworks
---
To achieve this goal we develop novel frameworks to reason about privacy in large-scale data processing systems and aim to improve existing approaches to evaluate privacy risk.

As an example, we developed a new [framework](https://github.com/spring-epfl/synthetic_data_release) to quantitatively assess claims about the privacy benefits of synthetic data publishing.
Using our framework, we demonstrated that many of the claims made about the "absolute privacy" ([NHS England](https://data.england.nhs.uk/dataset/a-e-synthetic-data)) synthetic data provides do not hold true.

This is one example that shows how important it is to carefully evaluate the privacy properties of data processing systems.

Analysis of Real-World Systems
---
A large part of my research is dedicated to the analysis of real-world systems. 
Examples of this are our comparative analysis of the privacy and security risks of digital proximity tracing systems (a [DP-3T](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/Security%20analysis/Privacy%20and%20Security%20Attacks%20on%20Digital%20Proximity%20Tracing%20Systems.pdf) contribution)
and our [analysis of the potential harms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11958) of the LUCA tracing system.

Analysing the privacy properties of novel complex systems is a challenging task as there are no standardised ways to conduct such an analysis.
The analysis process itself is thus an important part of our research.
It helps us to understand how we reason about privacy in different types of systems and enables us to improve guidelines for practitioners.

Beyond informing our research, our work has had a considerable impact on the design of digital aids for pandemic containment.

Design of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies
---
I was involved in the development and design of many real-world systems in which privacy played a key role.

As part of the DP-3T project, I helped to develop a protocol for privacy-preserving decentralised proximity tracing that was later adopted by many countries around the world.
At Privitar, I worked with a large number of organisations, across sectors and industries, to find general purpose technologies to enable the ethical and safe use of data.
